The local Git repository for the Blockchain Tracker web application has been successfully initialized and the first commit has been made. To connect this local repository to your existing GitHub repository and push the code, please follow these steps:

1.  **Navigate to your project directory:** Open your terminal or command prompt and go to the directory where the `blockchain-tracker-web` folder is located.
2.  **Add the remote repository:** Use the following command to add your GitHub repository as a remote to your local repository. Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with the name of your GitHub repository:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    ```
3.  **Verify the remote:** You can verify that the remote repository has been added correctly by running:
    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```
    This should display the fetch and push URLs for your remote repository.
4.  **Push the code:** Finally, push your local changes to the remote repository on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```
    This command pushes the `main` branch of your local repository to the `origin` remote (your GitHub repository).

After completing these steps, your code will be available on your GitHub repository.
